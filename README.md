This package is a Symfony2 Admin Generator based on YAML configuration and Twig templating.
It's inspired by [fzaninotto/Doctrine2ActiveRecord](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Doctrine2ActiveRecord).

It actually supports:

* Doctrine ORM
* Doctine ODM
* [Propel](http://github.com/propelorm/Propel)

With almost the same features:

* A YAML to configure create/edit/delete/list actions
* Manage relations one to one, one to many, many to one and **many to many**
* Easy edit of forms by changing properties of fields in YAML.
* Configure fieldsets
* Configure more that one field per line
* Change the database column you want to sortOn or filterOn for a field in list
* A complete admin design
* Translated into EN, FR, RU, PT, ES, SL, DE , PL, UA, IT (you can easily contribute to add your own)
* Filters by form & by scopes combinable
* Credentials for actions, columns, and form fields
* ...

The fastest way to try it is to setup the AdmingeneratorIpsum project: https://github.com/symfony2admingenerator/AdmingeneratorIpsum.
